      description: `I’m an avid backpacker who embraces the outdoors in every season—rain, shine, or sub-freezing snow. I find peace and purpose off the grid, where the air is crisp and the challenges are real. Cold mornings, snow-covered trails, and quiet forests are where I feel most alive. This is where I reset, reflect, and push past limits.`,

My time in uniform taught me the value of discipline, leadership, and teamwork—qualities I carry with me into every project I build. Serving in the military gave me the mindset to overcome challenges, stay mission-focused, and always back up my team. That experience shaped who I am today and fuels my drive in the tech world.`,
